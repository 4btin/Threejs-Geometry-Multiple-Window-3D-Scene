# Multiple Window 3D Scene using Three.js

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a unique approach to creating and managing a 3D scene across multiple browser windows using Three.js and localStorage. It's designed for developers interested in advanced web graphics and window management techniques.

## Features
- 3D scene creation and rendering with Three.js.
- Synchronization of 3D scenes across multiple browser windows.
- Dynamic window management and state synchronization using localStorage.
